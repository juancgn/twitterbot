# Twitterbot

Twitterbot is a Python-based bot for Twitter that reads tweets (called `quotes`) from a local SQLite database and automatically posts them on Twitter. I wrote it to post funny quotes from my favorite character from a CBS show automatically. The bot uses the Tweepy library for interacting with the Twitter API v2 and is designed to post at configurable times. Twitterbot only uses the free-of-charge tools of the Twitter API.

Twitterbot is designed to run permanently and therefore you should run it on a server, a Raspberry Pi oder another systems which is up permanently.

## Features

- **Database Connection:** The bot establishes a connection to a local SQLite database that manages quotes, queueing, and post logging.
- **Tweet Posting:** Quotes are posted as tweets using the Twitter API with Tweepy.
- **Scheduling:** Posting times are randomly generated within a configurable time range.
- **Logging:** Events and errors are logged to assist with performance monitoring and troubleshooting.
- **Queueing:** Used quotes will be queued randomly in the second half of the queue, so the quote selection is random enough but a quote is definitely not posted again too soon.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Tweepy 4.14.10 or newer
- SQLite (for the local database, comes with the Python standard library)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your server:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/juancgn/twitterbot.git
   cd twitterbot
   ```
2. Install tweepy with 
    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
## Usage

1. Write your quotes in a new file named `rawdata.txt`, one per line. Ensure they do not exceed 280 characters for Twitter. Copy this file to your server using, for example, ssh:
    ```
    scp [-i ssh_private_key] /path/on/your/computer/rawdata.txt username@SERVER_IP:/path/to/directory/of/twitterbot
    ```
2. Run the following command on your server to create a local SQLite database from the raw data:
    ```
    python3 database.py
    ```
3. Sign up for a [Twitter developer account](https://developer.x.com/en/docs/twitter-api/getting-started/getting-access-to-the-twitter-api) (the free plan is sufficient) and obtain the credentials from the developer portal.
4. Create a `cred.env` file and add your Twitter API credentials in the following format:: 
    ```
    consumer_key:XXXXXXX
    consumer_secret:XXXXXXX
    access_token:XXXXXXX
    access_token_secret:XXXXXXX
    ```
    Copy the credentials file to your server, too.
5. Adjust the posting hours in the `posting_hours.conf` file if desired. You can manipulate the file on the ssh terminal with: 
    ```
    vim posting_hours.conf
    ```
    Press `i` to manipulate the file, then `Esc` if finished and `:wq` to save and close.
6. Start the bot with 
    ```
    nohup python3 twitterbot.py &
    ```
    to start the bot and ensure it continues running in the background even when you log out from your server. The bot now posts daily new quotes from the database on the computed posting times.
7. To stop the bot, find out which process ID it has on your system with 
    ```
    ps aux | grep twitterbot
    ```
    and stop it with
    ```
    kill PROCESS_ID
    ```

## Notes
1. The script `database.py` also provides some other useful database related functions.
2. Ensure the hours in `posting_hours.conf` are 2 hours apart from each so the random computed posting times do not overlap. Based on those hours, the posting times are computed within the range of one hour before and one hour after.
3. The computed posting times will be logged daily in a `posting_schedule.log` file where you can check them at any time. Other logs will be written in a `twitterbot.log` file.
